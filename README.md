# Project_1_Advance_algorithms
This File will include both Algorithm 1: Island Problem and Algorithm 2: Unique starting city

How to execute the program:

1. Ensure Python3 is installed on your machine.
- https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.5/msi/
2 Additionally you will need the pandas library installed to see the dataframe visualization
- pip3 install pandas
or
- pip install pandas
3. Download file from Github and Open in the editor of your choice, we used VScode open the folder you downloaded from GitHub
4. Save the code in a file named "algorithm1.py" and "algorithm2.py".
5. Run the program using the command on the terminal: 
python algorithm1.py
python algorithm2.py

if this diddnt work use 
python3 algorithm1.py
python3 algorithm2.py
